### Heuristics and Severity Rating for conducting Usability Tests

Forsell, C., & Johansson, J. (2010, May). An heuristic set for evaluation in information visualization. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces (pp. 199-206). ACM.

### Heuristics

- 1. Information coding
     - Perception of information is directly dependent on the mapping of data elements to visual objects (graphing techniques, color, type and meaning of symbols,
        shading, transparency, etc). This can be enhanced by using realistic characteristics/techniques or the use of additional symbols (legends, scales, drop lines, grid
        lines). Is the mapping correct? Is it appropriate for the task at hand, does it support user’s perceptual capabilities?  
        Another important aspect is the use of alternative visual attributes or objects to represent information derived from the data like groups of elements in clusteredrepresentations. 
    
- 2. Minimal actions 
        - Concerns workload with respect to the number of actions (sets of inputs) necessary to accomplish a goal or a task. 
      The more numerous and complex the actions necessary are the more workload will increase. 
      It is here a matter of limiting/minimizing as much as possible the steps users must go through. 
- 3. Flexibility 
        -Refers to the means available to the users to customize the interface in order to take into account their working strategies and/or their habits, and the task
        requirements. Flexibility is reflected in the number of possible ways of achieving a given goal. In other words, it is the capacity of the interface to adapt to the
        users’ particular needs. Example: permit users to control display configuration, to define, change or remove default values etc. 
- 4. Orientation and help
        -Functions like support for the user to control levels of details, redo/undo of user actions and representing additional information (for example the path a user
        followed while navigating in a complex data structure) define help and user orientation features. 
- 5. Spatial organization
        -Concerns user’s orientation and awareness of location in the information space, the distribution of elements in the layout, precision and legibility, efficiency in
        space usage and distortion of visual elements. Is related to the overall layout of a visual representation and comprises analyzing how easy it is to locate and see an
        information element in a display (objects location) and to be aware of the own orientation in the information space, and the overall distribution of information
        elements in the representation (spatial orientation). Locating and analyzing an information element can be hard if some objects are occluded by others or if the
        layout does not follow a logical organization. 
        Spatial orientation which contributes for the user being aware of the distribution of information elements is dependent on the display of the reference context
        while showing a specific element in detail. Concerns the possibility and easiness of specifying what information should be displayed in the context area vs the
        detailed area, can the user control them separately or does selection in one area affect the other. 
- 6. Consistency
        -Refers to the way interface design choices (codes, naming, formats, procedures, etc.) are maintained in similar contexts, and are different when applied to
        different contexts. The design choices will be better recalled, located and recognized if they are stable within the system (e.g. between screens or sessions). This 
        way the system will be more predictable, learning and generalization are facilitated and errors are reduced.  
- 7. Recognition rather than recall 
        -Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue
        to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often
        speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to use shortcuts or tailor
        frequent actions for their own needs. (Focused on allowing the user additional options to sidestep regular interaction techniques). 
- 8. Prompting
        -Means available to guide the user towards making specific actions whether these be data entry or other tasks. Refers to all means that help to know all
        alternatives when several actions are possible depending on the contexts. Concerns: status information, that is, information about actual state or context of the
        system, information about help facilities and their accessibility.
- 9. Remove the extraneous
        -Concerns whether any extra information can be a distraction and take the eye away from seeing the data or making comparisons. Present the largest amount of
        data with the least amount of ink. This involves judging whether any extraneous information is a distraction and/or slow-down.  Extra ink can be a distraction and 
        take the eye away from seeing the data or making comparisons. But removing too much can hinder the perception instead.
- 10. Data set reduction 
        -Concerns provided features for reducing a data set, their efficiency and ease of use. Filtering allows reduction of information shown at a certain moment, leading 
    more rapidly to adjustment of the focus of interest, and clustering allows representing a subset of data elements by means of special symbols, while pruning
    simply cuts off information irrelevant for the understanding of a visual representation.
    
### Severity ratings of the findings (Nielsen 1995)
    - 0 = I do not agree that this is a usability problem at all
    - 1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
    - 2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
    - 3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high  priority 
    - 4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be  released
