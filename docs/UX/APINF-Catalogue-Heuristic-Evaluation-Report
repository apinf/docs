- format:
    <no> <problem name> [violated heuristic(s)][Severity Rating]
    <Description>
    <Possible Solution>
    


- 1. When user is logged in, s/he needs to navigate to Catalogue via dashboard page. There is no way to navigate there directly. [2,3][2]
    - user can't directly access to catelogue via top menu or any other button/link in the main page view when logged in. With unanonymous view, a link to catelgue appears at top right menu
    - Provide link to catelogue when user is logged in; keep a button "Browse APIs" below search field in Landing page [ref. https://market.mashape.com/]
    
- 2. On landing page, there is no way to Add new API [2,3]2]
    - When user is logged in, in the landing page, there is no direct way to add new API. User has to do it either by first time registering or navigating via dashboard -> API Backend -> Add API Backend
    - Add a button in the landing page "Add new API" below the search field. [ref. https://market.mashape.com/]

- 3. There is no way to change language setting other than Landing page[2,3][2]
    - User can't change language from dashboard.
    - Provide option to change language at all location of the site.

- 4. No Card view of the catelogue to show brief view about APIs [1,5][3]
    - Only tabular view is avaulable where information is not layered in an efficient way
    - New card view of APIs, option to toggle between tabular and card view, no page load should be used for toggling [ref: https://market.mashape.com/explore]

- 5. User is not aware of his location in the site unless s/he manually checks it. [5,6][2]
    - only way to know the location is via URL or clicking menu within the user dashboard/ hovering on the left menu icons when collapsed.
    - provide breadcrums to show the location

- 6. Tabular view of API: can be sorted only by alphabetically ascending/descending order on Name and API backend column. Also on first glance, sorting order is no visible/understandable. [1, 3][3]
    - There is no way to make the APIs available as most popular, most recently added, most reliable, etc.
    - Other sorting order should be added for the API list appearance: Most Recent, Most Popular, Most Reliable, Uptime, Alpha, Relevent (if category is implemented), My APIs (bookmarked and or added), Depricated, etc.
    - ref: Research docs for IBM, Marketmashup and programmable Web

- 7. Tabular View: How Searching works is not visible/ understandable. [3][3]
    - It is not clear how the seach result is returned. There is no way to customize searching outcome
    - Add menu/ visible options for renderin searching result: All, Most Recent, Most Popular, Most Reliable, Uptime, Alpha, Relevency (category/keyword), Depreicated, My APIs (bookmaked/added)
    - For quantifiable rendering options, add asc/des. orders.

- 8. Tabular view: Current columns take too much space for appearance, there is no way to incorporate other necessary information. [1,5][3]
    - There is no provision to show additional information like Developers, Uptime, Category, free/paid, etc.
    - Columnns in table can be reshaped and rearranged to add other necessary information. Information can be shown as icons with details appearing on mouse hover

- 9. tabular view: columns to show API details and bookmarks take too much space. [9][3]
    - Showing options to to navigate to API page is redundant. bookmarking the API takes too much space.
    - Navigation should be possible by clicking on the API Name. To show brief overview, can use IBM style: details pane on clicking info icon [ref:https://developer.ibm.com/api/list/layout-list:sort-created:direction-DESC:lang-en_US ]
    - Bookmark option can be shown as bookmark icon/star (my favorite). The funtionality can be shown on mouse hover/info icon.
    
- 10. No help text/guiding instructions are present in th catelogue page to guide the user on how to interact with the API catelogue. [8][2]
    - User may get confused on how to use the catalogue page as there is no guidance provided for it.
    - Tutorial/Summary guidance on top of page with info icons/info icon at different places giving information about relevant functionalities.

- 11. APIs can only be seen/recognized with their names. There is no logo to represent them. [1][1]
    - People might not remember what an API does by only seeing their name. Currently, there is no way to show categories of API.
    - Give provision to upload API logo. Show them in tabular view and (if implemented) card view. [ref: https://developer.ibm.com/api/list] [ref: https://market.mashape.com/explore]

- 12. There is no way to categorize APIs based on their type [1][3]
    - It is difficult to tell what an API does by only looking at the tabular information. User needs to visit the details page to know its purpose and often deetails are not given.
    - Category tags [reference: https://market.mashape.com/explore]; Provision to select multiple catalogues for one API

- 13. There is no way to filter APIs. [1,3][3]
    - User can't restrict search results by narrowing down APIs of his/her interest. 
    - Filtering menu: By categories; by Protocols; by stage: Preview, Beta, Live (ref: IBM); Updated; Recent; Bookmarked; Most Popular (how to determine it? by counting star numbers?); My APIS;
    - Multi selection filter
    - explaination text about specific filtering options.
    -clear all filter option

- 14. When user is logged in, rating an API only shows the user's current rating. Information about people who rated it disappears. [1][2]
    - Information about who previously rated it no longer appears when a logged in user rates an API
    - show user rating in the main view; show no. of people rating the APi and average rating in an expanded menu

- 15. Alert text while rating API without logging in is not relevant to the context. [6][2]
    - 
    - Change the text as: "Please sign in or register for rating an API"; Disable the rating option when user is not logged in

- 16. Bookmark option appears enable when catalogue is browsed without logging in. Also Bookmark option doesn't use apropriate metaphore. [6][2]
    -
    - Disable the rating option when user is not logged in/ Add S-alert: "Please sign in or register for bookmarking an API"; use star or bookmark icon for representing the function. [ref: IBM, Marketmashup]

- 17. Pagination appears only in the bottom of the page. [2][1]
    - user needs to browse down the view to go to the next page of API catalogue
    - show pagination option in both top and bottom side of the webpage. 

- 18. No. of entries to show in each page in tabular view should be changed. [1][1]
    - 
    - 50, 100, all, etc./ will depend on how much API is going to be hosted.

- 19. When user is logged in, if s/he changes API sorting order on tabular view and revisits the page, the previously set sorting order is not maintained. [6,7][2]
    - user may wish to remember how he sorted out the available list on returning back to API page after other navigation. The current functionality prevents this.
    - should maintain user's sortiing order when logged in.
    - is also applicable (if implemented) filtering option is used (unless clear filer is performed).

- 20. On landing page search, suggestions not relevant to APIs also appear. [6][2]
        - Now on typing something in search field, autofilled data appears as suggestion even though they are not related to any API
        - When user is typing keywords, suggestions related to APIs should only appear. Not auto filled irrelevalent data of users or previous search queries
