    * High Priority Requirements:
        * List of APIs owned
        * Status of API: Good, Alert, Bad [Green, Yellow, Red]
        * No. of errors associatesd (if any) --> as Overview information
        * Some comparison of usage from previous times: (last day, same day of last week, same day of last month, same day of last year, etc)
        * Overview Information: Amount of Usage, Average Response Time, Errors (percentage of the overall requests), Unique Users
        * User Information: URL (Referrer header, source header)L if not available: IP address
        * Context Awareness: API name is enough
        * HTTP Status: how many are 200 and how many are 400
        * Minimum unit of time: hours, with individual intervals
        * Default Analytics View: Weekly (negotiable)
        * Timeline as line plot
        * Timeline is more important than heatmap
        * Meaningful Timestamps
    
    * Good To have:
        * Chart: Aggregrated Overview, individual API Overview
        * Aggregrated information of usage about a single API key
        * Date picker for manual time range entry
        * Link to details about Unique Users and Average Response Times
        * individual control at timeline, table and heatmap to affect each other
        * Specific information about a single API User.
