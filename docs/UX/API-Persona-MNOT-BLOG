### API Consumers

- Joe at HugeCorp
    - Uses Java (or some similar statically typed language). 
    - Used to having good tool support, with IDEs that manage all of the sticky details for him, and language features that keep him out of trouble.
    - may not be able to adopt new things easily because of organization policy (always having best approached even if it is old)
    - will need crystal-clear documentation for an API, with examples in his language — and ideally tool support — easily available. 
    - He’ll also likely want a “contract” locking in all aspects of the API, including the URIs and payload formats. (need to address this with language bindings)
