## Reference sites

**Benchmarking the sites of API management products**
<undefined><li>**Apigee Edge**</li></undefined>

The page dedicated to [Apigee Edge](http://apigee.com/about/products/api-management) presents all the features of Edge: designing, securing, scaling, publishing, visualisizing, monetizing and comparing API's. All features have their own section on the page, available from the sidebar. 

What I liked:

*   diagrams of the product, particularly the one at the top of the page > make the page very visual and uncluttured
*   downloadable material (books and pdfs) that demonstrates their expertise on APIs
*   having separate sections for each feature
*   sidebar: easy access to all sections
*   Next steps: link to demo and sign-up

What I don't like

*   The page is too long
*   Link to demo and sign-up only at the bottom of the page, should be sooner
*   The video
*   Too many different visual elements or styles on the same page > cleaner style would appear more modern
