# Outline for Apinf launch presentation

The following outline is based on a brainstorming session concerning Apinf launch in Mindtrek September 2015.

*   Open APIs vs. closed APIs
*   How we make managers to understand why they should share their APIs
*   User roles in API management
*   Different models for API management
*   API > proxy > app
*   Benefits of a proxy (exploring examples of API proxies, showing e.g. API Umbrella diagram, Kong diagram)

        *   Resource savings (time, money, effort)

*   "Dangers" of API proxy> loss of autonomy, privacy concerns
