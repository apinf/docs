# 2015-04-21 Needs assessment meeting: minutes

*   Resources available:

        *   Brylie
    *   Eric: Might be able to help with Ruby on Rails
    *   Juuso
    *   Taija (?)
    *   Vesa (?)

*   Technologies to be used

        *   API Umbrella:

                *   Built with Ruby on Rails (server) and Angular.Js (client).
        *   Stack builct with Node.Js.
        *   We need documentation about the Developer portal API to be able to extend the API.

        *   Current assumption of implementation needs for existing support: API development + client development.
    *   API development: Ruby on Rails and maybe Node.Js
    *   Client-side development: de facto language is Javascript. Which framework? The selection can affect the product life-cycle and capabilites, also the expertise needed. (On the other hand, if the APIs are very good, client-side can be easily changed)

*   Tasks

        *   SW design: API and client > developer needed?
    *   UX: Existing resources take care of this

                *   designing the UI and interaction, visual appearance
        *   usability testing
