## Warm-up: Happiness histogram

We used the [Happiness histogram](http://nomad8.com/chart-your-happiness/) as a warm-up exercise to evaluate, what do the team members think about how successfully and efficiently our team is collaborating.

## Coming up with working agreements

The warm-up exercise prepared us for the main theme of the meeting: coming up with working agreements. Working agreements are a set of rules or processes the team identifies and formulates together and agrees to follow to become more efficient as a team.

Firstly, we had individual brainstorming to gather insights on issues (both positive ad negative) related to past/current team cooperation. The insights were gathered on sticky notes. Each team member presented their post-it notes, which were then grouped to 6 groups. We started working on the most popular groups, used dot voting to identify the most important issues. Based on the findings, we formulated 5 working agreements.

**Our set of working agreements**

_Emphasize teamwork by daily pair programming and task splitting._

_Participate in sprint pre-planning at least once a month._

_Keep meetings brief and relevant._

_Communicate task progress on daily basis by updating time estimates and linking PR's and commits._

_Always review others' work thoroughly._
