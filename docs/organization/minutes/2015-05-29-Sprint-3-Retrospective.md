# 2015-05-29 : Sprint 3 retrospective

## Sailboat exercise

We used the [Sailboat technique](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Sailboat "Sailboat") to identify wind (positive forces that are propelling / would propel us forward) and anchors (negative forces that are slowing us down). We first wrote our ideas on sticky notes, then grouped the common ones. After grouping, we voted to be able to discuss the most relevant ones. Finally, we gathered ideas on how to improve our way of working.

## Ideas and Discussion

**Planning**

*   Knowledge issues affect planning (e.g. decision making)
*   Find tasks to suit individual skills

        *   Team members self-select tasks

*   Conduct a user story planning poker ASAP
*   Have post-stand-up discussions for specific topics

        *   issues
    *   technologies
    *   ideas

*   Estimate remaining working time for tasks during daily stand-ups

**Decision making**

*   Allow specialists to make relevant decisions
*   The group can vote on more general decisions
*   Trust decisions made by others

**Reuse**

*   We are using many existing efforts
*   Before building our own tools, solutions, etc., check out existing options

**Learning Curve**

*   Decisions made now have lasting effects
*   We need courage to make timly decisions
*   We decided to use JavaScript for primary development (with CoffeeScript for special cases)
*   Balance between new and known technologies
*   Each task has a learning curve
*   Do tasks together

        *   reduces stress
    *   socially fulfilling
    *   talk through problems

*   Do more pair programming
*   Use existing learning materials

        *   learn in spare time
    *   conduct co-learning sessions
