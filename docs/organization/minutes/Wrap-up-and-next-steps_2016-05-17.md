#Dipor project wrap-up and Apinf next steps 2016-05-17

##Dipor wrap-up

###What went well
- Code quality improved
- Learning
  - Proficiency of the teamâ€™s developers: all developers can also do code reviews
  - New or update technologies: Meteor 1.3, structuring, packaging, SAML, Swagger, Flow router
  - Analytics
- Managed to deliver to our customer what they wanted
- Being able to focus, understand the requirement and deliver a working project
- Boldness at learning and trying out
- Having UX involvement
- Thinking what to do rather than how to do

###What could have gone better
- Requirements:
  - we could/should have helped the customer to clarify
  - Prioritization and focus
- Big picture missing, too much short-term planning
- Backlog estimations missing
- Wireframes should precede development > or else there will be inconsistency, rework

###What could be improved
- UX
  - Paperprototyping and testing based on that
  - Wireframing to precede development
- Planning and requirements
  - Big picture
  - Backlog
  - Iterative
  - Team effort partially
- Open development
  - Open process: what do we mean with open process
  - Code of conduct into use
  
###What to reuse in Apinf
- Structure
  - Project folder structure (components, modules)
  - Using Flow Router
- Apinf API, using Restivus Swagger
- Analytics: process of using charts, componentizing
