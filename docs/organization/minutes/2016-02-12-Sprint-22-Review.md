## Damir (via email)

- #744 (automated testing) Since we are moving from "Velocity" to "Intern" as a testing solution for Apinf, there are some issues that pop up during the migration process. At the same time it took some time to do a research about Intern itself. Still working on this issue with Brylie's help.
- #785 (data table header i18n) This issue required significant refactoring of the dashboard code. (Why this is happening is noted in the comments of that issue on GitHub (https://github.com/apinf/api-umbrella-dashboard/issues/785)).
- Having some progress in it. Dashboard code is refactored and deciding how to update data table headers is left.
- #800 (Swagger UI Base URL) Resolved & closed.
- #815 (Usage instructions fix) Resolved, closed & merged
- #816 (Define date format in setting & user locale) CreatedPR #872.
