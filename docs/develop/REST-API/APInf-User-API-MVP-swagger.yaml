    ### For API owners 
    
    APInf provides you with a unified, simple interface for publishing your APIs to the developer community and performing complex API management tasks. It allows you to gain a better understanding of your API trafﬁc. 
    
     Each organization has organization page which provides single URL to promote to developers. 
    
    ### For developers (API end-user) 
    For developers APInf catalog and dashboard offers a one stop location to discover APIs, track your application API usage, and more.
    
    ### APInf User API
    With this API you can Add, Update and Remove (CRUD) information about APInf service users.
    
    ### Examples for each method to get you started
    
    In documentation each of the methods contain simple examples to get you started. Here's an example.
    
    Example call: ``` GET /apis?limit=200&lifecycle=production``` 
        
    Result: returns maximum of 200 APIs which are in production lifecycle. More examples can be found under each method. 
  
    ### API keys, authentication and dates 
    
    * We require API key in all GET methods. You can get it by creating account to APInf system. Create it now from https://apinf.io/sign-up 
    * PUT and DELETE methods require valid authentication. 
    * User with role Admin can manage other users data, too. Other users can manage their own data only.
    * Dates and times are returned in ISODate format, for example "2012-07-14T01:00:00+01:00".
