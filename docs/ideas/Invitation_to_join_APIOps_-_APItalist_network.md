# Invitation to join APIOps & APItalist network

McKinsey Global Institute  estimates the potential economic impact of the Internet of Things to be  $2.7 trillion to $6.2 trillion per year by 2025.  The GSM Association  predicts that by 2020, there will be 24 billion connected devices, while  Cisco’s Internet of Everything prediction is 50 billion “intelligent  things,” such as cars,  appliances, smartphones, tablets, monitoring  sensors and more, connected  to the Internet. The rise of IoT depends on  a whole host of enabling technologies like  RFID, IPv6, Big Data, and  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 

Web APIs, or more  specifically REST APIs, are key for connecting devices to the Internet. Companies focusing on enabling fast API development together with customers and nearby interest groups will rule the IoT.

**Together APIOps and APItalist are winning combination**

Just  like DevOps can be seen as offspring  or spinoff of Agile thinking,  APIOps can be seen to extend DevOps to  fulfil the needs of Application  Interface and Internet of Things  development (IoT).  Therefore we - APIOps community - foresee clear need for APIOps, a new  breed of DevOps to support creation and maintenance of IoT driven  ecosystem. APIOps alone does not do the trick. They are highly talented and trained API tech experts. They need the help of APItalist - the talent to create business plans and API-strategies. APItalist is the engine to create value. 

**Immediate  traction**

We have kickstarted the APIOps network in Tampere, Finland just recently with first in the world APIOps Meetup. The meetup caught the attention of the biggest API -management company 3Scale.com. We were also invited to present the concept to API Strategy & Practice Conference in Austin Texas November 18-20, 2015. After that we have been contacted by several companies. All this  clearly indicates that APIOps & APItalist  concept fills in a hole. 

**New groups supported**

New groups are spawning also in Helsinki, Switzerland, Estonia and New Zealand. Our intention is to grow the network to contain activities in all continents. For those interested to initiate APIOps meetup in local city, we offer the following support: 

*   6 months Meetup.com service payments 
*   Online tutoring before the first meetup (skype, hangout)
*   community support  from experienced community managers and meetup organizers
*   Ready-made  presentations to use as inspiration
*   Top class developer friendly API -management environment

We are also in the middle of creating  three short 1-2 minutes long animations about the following topics:

*   What is APIops?
*   What is APItalist? 
*   Why APIOps and APItalist is winning combination?

**Certificates for APIOps and APItalist**
