### UI
Simple UI, clear navigation.
Snapping menu is nice.
No pagination.

### Strengths
A lot of APIs
Quite some users already, so good metadata.

### Weaknesses
Search does not take into account semantics: recipes and cooking did not return results, food did.
Search is in a strange location, not intuitive.
No multiple tags can be selected.
Some functionality does not work (well), feels a bit buggy
