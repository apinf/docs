    preliminary research --> how to document use cases for UI testing + getting feedback from users about design + structure
    Very clear use cases that are documented
    how to achieve something with expected result that contribute to business values
    expectations: from visual elements and actions
    instructions: 
      1. scenarios (for major elements & actions)
      2. Use cases
    Right Usecases for right audiance:
      
    Questions:
