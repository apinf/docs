## Proposed changes

We want the user interface to be as clear, crisp and minimalistic as possible.

We decided to share the profile page to four different blocks. The  blocks can be either:

1.  All on one page
2.  All on one page, on different tabs
3.  All on different pages

## The blocks 

**First block: Profile information**

*   Name
*   Email
*   Company
*   Profile picture
*   Connected social media accounts

**Second block: Settings**

*   Old password
*   New password
*   Confirm password

**Third block: Billing info**

*   Card number
*   Expire date
*   Name on card
*   Security code
*   Address line 1
*   Address line 2
*   City
*   State
*   Postal / zipcode
*   Country

**Fourth block: Admin block**

Only visible for API administrator - This way we dont have to design two different profiles.

More details later.

## Design

As referred above the profile is shared to four different blocks. The  blocks can be either:

**All on one page**
